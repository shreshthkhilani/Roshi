The awards are managed by the NYAS and funded by the Blavatnik Family Foundation, an active supporter of numerous leading educational, scientific, and cultural institutions throughout the United States and the world. The Blavatnik Family Foundation was founded by Len Blavatnik, an American industrialist and chairman of Access Industries&#x2014;a privately-held, global industrial group.Until 2013, the Blavatnik Awards were limited to young scientists in the New York Tri-State area.

It provides knowledge, information and advocacy to improve the quality and supply of water in North America and beyond.  AWWA advances public health, safety and welfare by uniting efforts of the full spectrum of the water community.  AWWA&#x2019;s Government Affairs Office, where this internship is located, is in Washington, DC and is minutes away from Capitol Hill, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the White House.  Those three entities (Congress, the EPA, and other executive branch agencies) are the focus of most of AWWA&#x2019;s governmental affairs efforts. Staff closely coordinate their many activities through the Water Utility Council (WUC) to develop action programs to initiate, evaluate, respond and comment within the framework of Association policy, on legislative, regulatory, and other matters which directly affect water utilities.  You can read more about AWWA&#x2019;s Government Affairs Office on our website. The selected candidate will have the primary responsibility of developing and executing work on one major project for the duration of the internship. The main objective of the internship is completing a project and associated paper to be submitted to Journal &#x2013; AWWA for peer review and publication.  Examples of published papers from previous intern projects are listed at the end of this announcement and can be accessed in full on Journal-AWWA&#x2019;s website.  The selected candidate will also attend meetings and briefings in the area to gain an understanding of the breadth of water policy issues covered by the DC Office.  The student will work with AWWA staff on a project that would best fit his or her qualifications and our priority regulatory issues such as cyanotoxins, lead and copper, disinfection by-products (DBPs), and the energy-water nexus. Potential projects ideas include the following:&#x2022;&#9;Analysis of Monitoring and Reporting Violations versus Violations of Standards &#x2013; This analysis would compare the two types of violations to determine if monitoring and reporting violations are a precursor of violations of the standards.  &#x2022;&#9;Analysis of Capacity vs. Demand in the Very Large Systems &#x2013; This analysis will develop case studies of the approximately 30 very large systems that serve more than one million people looking at the current system capacity vs. demand, and also the project capacity vs. demand for the system.&#x2022;&#9;A Political Map of Drinking Water in America &#x2013; This analysis would identify the issues associated with drinking water regulation and legislation on a state-by-state basis with an emphasis on the top media markets of the US (potentially at a city/county level as well).  The analysis would be sufficiently detailed to help focus grassroots outreach and media actions by AWWA.  The three projects listed above are examples. Other water policy projects addressing important water sector issues such as climate change, sustainability, effectiveness of regulations, water infrastructure financing, affordability of water, water security and preparedness, the water-energy nexus, and others could be considered for the internship depending on qualifications and current drinking water policy needs.  Qualifications:&#x2022;&#9;Graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Environmental Science, Master of Science in Environmental Engineering, and/or Master of Environmental/Public Policy preferred.  Undergraduate students that have completed at least their sophomore year will also be considered.  &#x2022;&#9;Excellent communication skills&#x2022;&#9;Experience with environmental issues preferred&#x2022;&#9;Must be able to work independently with minimal supervisionWage/Salary Information:  &#9;Depending on qualificationsDeadline to Apply:  &#9;&#9;5 PM ET, March 4, 2016How to Apply:  Please visit http://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/career-center/jobseeker.aspx?activeview=jobdetails&amp;joblistingid=14003 to submit a resume and cover letter explaining why you wish to take part in this internship.

Ultimately, you&#x2019;ll help us build the kind of public support it takes to make a difference.Campaigns:We&#x2019;re working to tackle global warming. What problem could be bigger or more profound? Global warming is a ticking time bomb for life on the planet. So how do we defuse it? One big step we can take is to replace dirty fossil fuel power with clean, renewable power. That&#x2019;s exactly what Austin, Texas, is doing now. The city recently agreed to close the Decker Power Plant &#x2013; the nation&#x2019;s largest standing source of smog-forming pollution. And Austin is adding enough solar energy to power 130,000 homes. Impact interns in Austin helped make it happen. They hustled to identify and turn out pro-solar supporters to candidate forums and other events right before a critical city-commission vote.We&#x2019;re working to stop the overuse of antibiotics on factory farms. Can you imagine what would happen to our lives if antibiotics stopped working, if simple infections became life-threatening? Well, it turns out that antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Yet factory farms keep pumping antibiotics into the daily feed of perfectly healthy animals &#x2013; putting our lives at risk in the process &#x2013; just to fatten them up a little faster. That&#x2019;s ridiculous. We need to change the rules and change the marketplace so it makes more sense to go antibiotic-free than to continue doing business as usual. And it&#x2019;s now starting to happen: McDonald&#x2019;s recently agreed to stop the routine use of human antibiotics on the chicken it sells. A team of Impact interns helped inspire tens of thousands of people to demand the change and Impact organizers earned coverage for their work in The New York Times and The Washington Post.We&#x2019;re working to protect our rivers, lakes and streams. What could be more obvious, right? We need clean water to live. So how do we prevent more problems like the recent big chemical spill in West Virginia or the massive toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie, both of which left hundreds of thousands of people without clean drinking water? For starters, we need to restore Clean Water Act protection to streams that were left open to polluters because of loopholes in the law. That&#x2019;s what President Obama and the EPA agreed to do this past May. The move generated intense opposition from oil companies and other polluters. But our team of Impact interns in seven key states worked hard to counter the polluters&#x2019; pressure by mobilizing more than 1,000 business owners, local elected officials, farmers and other influential voices.Becoming an Impact internIf you agree that it&#x2019;s time to solve these big problems, the best thing you can do to get involved is to apply to intern with Impact today: weareimpact.org/internship-apply.htmlAs an intern:-       You&#x2019;ll learn how to analyze problems, push for smart solutions, and build the public support it takes to win.-       You&#x2019;ll work side-by-side with one of our organizers, learning the ropes.-       And you'll attend briefings and trainings to learn even more about the issues and gain organizing skills.And if you&#x2019;re thinking you might want to make a career out of solving big problems like global warming &#x2013; interning with Impact is one of the best ways to get started.We&#x2019;re hiring interns in Washington D.C. and in 25 states nationwide.

That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve developed a graduate program with two distinct streams that provide opportunities for the next generation of business leaders and engineers alike. Our Future Business Leaders stream is a structured, closely monitored, two to three year rotational program. The program will be a series of six to nine month rotations across the US in various disciplines, including Program Management, Strategic Sourcing, Operations, Business Development, Procurement, Commercial, Sales and Marketing, Finance, and Human Resources. The program will allow you to explore some of Cobham&#x2019;s offices located in California, Arizona, Iowa, New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.   The duration of the program is customized to fit your and the businesses needs and will commence at the beginning of September. The recruitment and selection process comprises online application, telephone interview, online test and assessment centre, and we would advise you to apply for this opportunity at the beginning of your senior year of college. How quickly you are taken through the process will be dependent on assessment centre dates, although the sooner you apply the more likely it is you&#x2019;ll be considered for the assessment centre and therefore selected to join the program. No matter what area you choose to go into, you can count on maximum exposure to our technology and global culture, so you&#x2019;ll be required to complete placements across at least three of our divisions. Where you are placed in the US depends on your career aspirations and what stream you decide to follow, but wherever you go with us you&#x2019;ll find support and development opportunities, regular reviews and frequent training sessions. The program is big in its scope and goals, but not overly so - everyone knows each other, and you&#x2019;ll have plenty of time to build your social and professional networks.Throughout the program, you'll have regular performance and development reviews with your assignment manager. You'll also be given a mentor who will provide personal and professional support, and a development log that will help you keep track of your progress. And if you want to gain a relevant professional qualification, such as chartered status or a professional certification, we'll support you all the way. At the end of the program, you'll have the opportunity to apply for a permanent position anywhere within the business. Where you end up is up to you, but in a company as diverse as ours, you'll always have interesting opportunities. What&#x2019;s more, every placement you take part in will be vastly different from the others, and there&#x2019;ll never be any doubt that the work you&#x2019;re doing is adding significant value to the company.If you will have the right to work in the US at the time of starting your employment, and a 3.5 GPA in a business or engineering discipline, we want to hear from you - even if you have a few years of work experience. We&#x2019;re interested in graduates from any degree discipline that requires the analysis and manipulation of large amounts of quantitative data, but a degree in a subject like Geography or English could also prove useful. Regardless of your degree focus, we're looking for enthusiasm, an innovative spirit and the kind of big ideas that will help shape the future of Cobham and make a difference in the communities we work in. In return, you&#x2019;ll have the chance to show us what you can do right from day one, as well as receive plenty of executive exposure in order to give you the skills you need to become a future leader.Please be advised, Cobham do not offer sponsorship.

At Cobham, we&#x2019;ve got what it takes to turn our graduates into the next generation of innovators, pioneers and entrepreneurs. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve developed a graduate program with two distinct streams that provide opportunities for the next generation of business leaders and engineers alike. Our Functional Excellence stream for engineers is a structured, closely monitored, two to three year rotational program. The program will be a series of six to nine month rotations in various disciplines, and will allow you to explore some of Cobham&#x2019;s offices located in California, Arizona, Iowa, New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.  The duration of the program is customized to fit your and the businesses needs and will commence at the beginning of September. The recruitment and selection process comprises online application, telephone interview, online test and assessment centre, and we would advise you to apply for this opportunity at the beginning of your senior year of college. How quickly you are taken through the process will be dependent on assessment centre dates, although the sooner you apply the more likely it is you&#x2019;ll be considered for the assessment centre and therefore selected to join the program. No matter what area you choose to go into, you can count on maximum exposure to our technology and global culture, so you&#x2019;ll be required to complete placements across at least three of our divisions. Where you are placed in the US depends on your career aspirations and what stream you decide to follow, but wherever you go with us you&#x2019;ll find support and development opportunities, regular reviews and frequent training sessions. The program is big in its scope and goals, but not overly so - everyone knows each other, and you&#x2019;ll have plenty of time to build your social and professional networks.Throughout the program, you'll have regular performance and development reviews with your assignment manager. You'll also be given a mentor who will provide personal and professional support, and a development log that will help you keep track of your progress. And if you want to gain a relevant professional qualification, such as chartered status or a professional certification, we'll support you all the way. At the end of the program, you'll have the opportunity to apply for a permanent position anywhere within the business. Where you end up is up to you, but in a company as diverse as ours, you'll always have interesting opportunities. What&#x2019;s more, every placement you take part in will be vastly different from the others, and there&#x2019;ll never be any doubt that the work you&#x2019;re doing is adding significant value to the company.If you will have the right to work in the US at the time of starting your employment, and a 3.5 GPA in an engineering discipline, we want to hear from you &#x2013; even if you have a few years of work experience. We're looking for enthusiasm, an innovative spirit and the kind of big ideas that will help shape the future of Cobham and make a difference in the communities we work in. In return, you&#x2019;ll have the chance to show us what you can do right from day one, as well as receive plenty of executive exposure in order to give you the skills you need to become a future leader. Please be advised, Cobham do not offer sponsorship.

The way in which we source investments is very similar to a traditional private equity firm, and this internship will therefore give you a useful set of skills if exploring a career path in private equity, investment banking or consulting.In return for unpaid work, and because we are a small firm, we will give you additional responsibility you wouldn't get at a large firm (if we can delegate to you, we will), opportunities to learn new skills, and letters of recommendation as well as introductions to our vast network of contacts in banks, consulting firms, other private equity firms, industry, etc.We are a start-up private equity firm founded in and based in Philadelphia. The founder is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Business School and has extensive experience in the investment banking and private equity field. Our strategy is to acquire an established small business and manage it directly. Our target industries are varying and you will research a multitude of interesting, different industries. Our target deal size is $2-20m.ResponsibilitiesThis is a demanding role, and as such we ask you to carefully read through the daily responsibilities -- we have tried to be as honest as possible so there is no confusion as to what this job entails.[% of intern time][5%] Industry research - finding and reading industry reports, news articles, etc. to understand how firms make money in an industry and what the most important trends are. The skill we want you to develop is to quickly synthesize a large amount of information and be able to identify the 3-4 most important factors that make a business successful in a given industry.[80%] Creating databases (of company contact information). - There are thousands upon thousands of small businesses in the US. Before we can start asking whether to invest in them we need a systematic way of contacting them and keeping track of communication. An unglamorous, but essential task. Computer and programming skills are helpful, but there is no substitute for hard work and grit.[5%] Company research -- many small business have a limited online presence. We want you to be able to dig deep and find out what makes a small business successful -- what is their product? Who are their competitors? What differentiates them? Form a judgment and be able to tell us in 2-3 sentences why we would/would not want to invest in them.[10%] Drafting letters to business owners -- use industry and company research to draft letters of approach to business owners.[2.5%] Financial modeling and benchmarking -- a skill sought by many leading finance companies but one we can teach you in an hour. Interns will be expected to learn how to build basic spreadsheets to help analyze potential investments.[2.5%] Drafting offer letters -- writing non-binding and binding letters of interest, gaining familiarity with legal terminology and deal structuring.We know that the above % don't add up to 100% -- each individual&#x2019;s experience will be slightly different -- we wanted to give you a directional sense. Interns will also take on at least one presentation project during their time here. This involves researching a specific (usually untapped) industry and specific company within it. They will formulate an opinion on both the industry and the company along with a price valuation, culminating in a short, 8-10 minute presentation.We work out of two shared office spaces in in the Drexel/UPenn area. Being a startup company, we are relatively relaxed in terms of our culture. We do not wear suits everyday, we wear whatever we feel is comfortable.

The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized standards dramatically cutting carbon pollution from power plants. This unprecedented step forward is facing enormous opposition from the fossil fuel industry and their allies in D.C. and Harrisburg.Pennsylvania is at the center of this fight.Nationally, Majority Leader McConnell along with major coal companies are leading the charge to rollback these climate pollution limits. And we'll need Senator Casey to stand with us to stop these attacks.Around the nation and in Pennsylvania, everyone is watching to see if Governor Wolf will implement a Clean Power Plan that transforms the 3rd largest emitter of carbon pollution the nation into a clean energy leader. But, coal companies are working with the conservatives in the legislature to interfere with this transformation.The next 8 months will help determine the success of the Clean Power Plan, and whether Pennsylvania and the nation will be on the path to a clean energy future. PennEnvironment is expanding our efforts to mobilize and engage tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians for climate action and build the movement to tackle climate change.

Seventy played a major role in the adoption of civil service reforms and the passage of the 1919 and 1951 Home Rule Charters. Seventy later produced comprehensive analyses on governmental agencies and departments, has filed amicus briefs on various electoral and City Charter issues and has been the area&#x2019;s most recognized crusader for safeguarding elections and protecting voters&#x2019; rights. Seventy continues this campaign today as the city&#x2019;s only independent and nonpartisan advocate for better government and politics. Whether in public or behind-the-scenes, Seventy uses its voice and influence to help provoke debate and spur real change.Although the organization&#x2019;s core competencies are ethics, campaign finance, and elections and voting, Seventy occasionally ventures into other policy areas including education, taxes and budgetary issues. Major recent initiatives include leading a nonpartisan coalition of 100+ organizations to educate voters about the 2012 Voter ID Law and advocating to tighten the city&#x2019;s gifts rules for public employees and officials.

        "desc": "PIRG stands for the Public Interest Research Group. We take on issues where the public needs a champion &#x2014; someone to stand up to powerful interests when they push the other way.Here&#x2019;s just one example: The overuse of antibiotics is creating &#x201C;superbugs&#x201D; that kill at least 23,000 Americans each year, and is getting so bad that doctors are worried antibiotics could stop working. Yet most antibiotics aren&#x2019;t used to treat sick people &#x2014; they're sold for use on livestock, and big factory farms routinely give them to animals that aren&#x2019;t even sick. That makes no sense whatsoever.So we organized consumers and ten thousand doctors nationwide to convince McDonald&#x2019;s to go antibiotic-free. With PIRGs in 25 states, we reached more than 125,000 people in the field and millions more online, and McDonald&#x2019;s agreed to stop selling chicken raised on human antibiotics. We still have more to do, but we&#x2019;re now seeing big changes in the food industry.We take the same non-partisan, fact-driven, result-oriented approach to problems ranging from money in politics to Wall Street reform. And these strategies have been effective for more than 40 years.  We&#x2019;re hiring Fellows to work on these problems: whether it&#x2019;s stopping the overuse of antibiotics on factory farms, or one of our other top priority campaigns like checking the influence of billionaires and Super PACs over our elections, giving consumers the right to know if GMOs are in their food, passing new recycling laws, or promoting smart transportation options for a 21st century economy.What Fellows DoOur Fellows don&#x2019;t just sit behind a desk. You&#x2019;ll be out in the real world &#x2014; recruiting new groups to join a coalition, speaking in a church basement or town hall to win a new endorsement, organizing a news event or rally, meeting with an editorial board, or doing whatever else it takes to urge our public officials to do the right thing. This is a two-year program, expressly designed to prepare future leaders within PIRG. We do have more problems than we should tolerate in America, and we have plenty of solutions that we could be putting to use. And while powerful industries and other special interests will continue hiring lobbyists, we need you to help us balance the scales, stand up for the public, and help solve more of America&#x2019;s problems.Locations and start datesWe&#x2019;re hiring for positions in D.C., Boston, and Chicago. If you&#x2019;re flexible, you can apply for multiple locations. We accept applications on a rolling basis. State date: August 1, 2016.Salary &amp; BenefitsSalary for this position is $25,500 in the first year and $27,000 in the second year. U.S. PIRG offers a competitive benefits package. Eligible staff receive health insurance, paid holidays, sick days, and vacation days; and the opportunity to enroll in our college loan assistance and 401(k) programs. We also offer an excellent training program and opportunities for advancement.U.S. PIRG is an equal opportunity employer and will not discriminate against any employee or applicant on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, sex, handicap, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or veteran status."

The successful candidate will have demonstrated expertise in broad areas of computational analysis of high dimensional systems, machine learning and empirical data analysis.  The candidate will be familiar with building and deploying database-driven computational analysis systems that carry out automated high-dimensional data analysis and data mining solutions. Familiarity with flow cytometry data, and in particular high dimensional flow cytometry data, while not required, will be a significant advantage, as will be a working knowledge of immunophenotyping of circulating cells and extracellular vesicles.  If not previously established, a willingness to acquire this highly specialized knowledge is a key requirement.The position requires demonstrated skills in scientific programming (e.g. preferably R, but also Matlab, C++, Python, Java or other data-centric languages), database design and administration (e.g. MySQL), system configuration and administration (e.g. linux, perl, bash), and web-based application deployment (e.g. apache, tomcat, PHP, Ruby/Rails, Grails, etc.).  Specific knowledge of R/Bioconductor, while not required, is a very strong plus.  The VP, Computation will build and lead a small but growing team of computational scientists, including programmers and data analysts.  This will require you to define, articulate and encourage best practices in areas such as software version control (e.g. git, subversion), test and release discipline (unit and integration), software deployment (in a dev/test/prod environment) and documentation.  Your compute infrastructure is cloud-based, so familiarity with AWS cloud computing will be a definite advantage.  Much of the technology developed by you and your group will eventually be submitted to the FDA for regulatory approval.  Consequently, you will be responsible for software validation and change control and your attention to detail in these areas will be critically important.The laboratory at CytoVas is currently in production mode.  So you and your team will not only be developing the data analysis infrastructure of the company, but also applying that infrastructure as scientific data analysts to consume, process, reduce and ultimately gain new knowledge from the data.You must possess outstanding leadership and communication skills, both oral and written.  You will work in a highly collaborative team environment and will interact daily not only with your computational team but also laboratory staff, marketing and sales, and executive leadership.  You will co-author scientific manuscripts at the cutting edge of the application of computational analysis of high dimensional biology.  You will play an important role in interactions with clients and investors, yet you will also have a hands-on role in your group&#x2019;s development activities.  You will possess a balanced mix of the visionary with the practical, and enthusiasm and energy to emphasize whichever is called for at the moment.CompanyCytoVas, LLC (www.cytovas.com) is an in-vitro diagnostics company that has developed a blood test using a combinatorial approach and novel biomarkers to improve assessment of a patient&#x2019;s vascular health.

Ultimately, you&#x2019;ll help us build the kind of public support it takes to win our campaigns.Our Campaigns &#x2022;&#9;We&#x2019;re doing our part to stop global warming: We took a big step forward when President Obama directed his Environmental Protection Agency to develop standards that would cut carbon pollution from power plants, the nation&#x2019;s largest contributors to global warming pollution. This historic step won&#x2019;t be enough to fully solve the problem, but it&#x2019;s an important start. Unfortunately, one of the most powerful special interests in the world -- the fossil fuel industry -- is standing in the way, at every step. That&#x2019;s where we come in. We&#x2019;re working to rally millions of American citizens, along with local elected officials and other powerful voices to back the President&#x2019;s plan and get it over the finish line.  &#x2022;&#9;We&#x2019;re making sure we don&#x2019;t frack our future: Dirty and dangerous fracking is risking our families&#x2019; health, contaminating our water, and turning our treasured landscapes into industrial zones. We know that this especially destructive method of drilling for gas pollutes our air and contributes significantly to global warming. We&#x2019;re working to offset the outsized influence of the oil and gas industry and keep our public health, environment, and communities protected from fracking&#x2019;s dangerous impacts. This fall we are launching our new Protect Our Children campaign to defend children -- an especially vulnerable population -- from the worst effects of fracking.&#x2022;&#9;We&#x2019;re working to protect our rivers, lakes and streams:  To protect our waterways from pollution and destruction, we need to crack down on factory farm pollution, sewage, and other threats. And we know it won&#x2019;t be easy because of big opposition from developers, giant agribusiness, and other polluters. We&#x2019;re working to harness the huge grassroots support for clean water and turn it into the political power we need to have a lasting direct impact on our waterways.Becoming a PennEnvironment internIf you agree that it&#x2019;s time to solve these big environmental problems, the best thing you can do to get involved is to apply to be a PennEnvironment today.
